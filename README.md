# chalkboardcss
# This contains the html and css coding I created for a cafe menu page to represent the chalk-board menu at the cafe. idea was to  see if I could use CSS to create a chalk board type effect. using colours that were are close as possible to the actual chalks used in the cafe (took a photograph and colour-picked the colours). 
# the cafemain.css has a section for a 'specials board' styling which is NOT used in the cmenu.html page, but was for another page which is not relevant to this.
# To view the actual website I coded (with help from some existing codes for various js and php form functions) it is at www.rhoscommunitycafe.com
